## What is merge sort?

Like quicksort, merge sort is a **Divide and Conquer** algorithm. It divides input array in two halves, calls itself for the two halves and then merges the two sorted haves. 
The merge() function is used for merging the two halves.
Merge sort is one of the most efficient sorting algorithm.

### Time Complexity:
Best: O(nLogn), 
Average: O(nLogn), 
Worst: O(nLogn)
### Space Complexity:
O(n)
